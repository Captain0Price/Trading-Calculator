#ðŸ”¢ How It Works
1) You input the capital, trading parameters, and assumptions.

2) The sheet randomly assigns winning and losing trades based on your win rate.

3) It calculates:

    Profit and loss using leverage

    Commission on both buy and sell (as per Binance trading fees)

4) The result gives you a clear picture of your strategy's potential impact on your capital.

##ðŸ“Œ Notes
The randomness in win/loss assignment helps simulate the uncertainty in real trading environments.

Commission rates are based on Binance's spot trading fee structure and can be updated if needed.

Designed primarily for educational and strategy testing purposes.
