# ðŸ”¢ How It Works
1) You input the capital, trading parameters, and assumptions.

2) The sheet randomly assigns winning and losing trades based on your win rate.

3) It calculates:

    Profit and loss using leverage

    Commission on both buy and sell (as per Binance trading fees)

4) The result gives you a clear picture of your strategy's potential impact on your capital.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
